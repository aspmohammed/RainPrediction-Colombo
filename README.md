## RainPrediction-Colombo
# Machine Learning for Rainfall Prediction in the Colombo Region, Sri Lanka
RainPredict-Colombo is a machine learning project focused on predicting daily rainfall (rain vs. no rain) in Colombo, Sri Lanka, using a dataset spanning January 2020 to June 2025. The project leverages a Random Forest Classifier to achieve an accuracy of 0.85, an F1-score of 0.76 for the rain class, and a ROC-AUC of 0.89, outperforming a Logistic Regression baseline. The dataset, sourced from the Sri Lanka Department of Meteorology and Kaggle, includes features such as mean temperature, maximum wind speed, evapotranspiration, and seasonality, with feature engineering to address missing predictors like humidity. The model supports applications in agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management by providing reliable rainfall forecasts in Colomboâ€™s monsoon-driven climate. The repository contains the complete ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation, along with visualizations like ROC curves and feature importance plots.
